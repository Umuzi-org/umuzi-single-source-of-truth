# Experience Labs Central Repository

## 1. Experience Lab Overview

This slab provides an overview of the Experience Lab and NPMN innovation fund grant, detailing helpful links to presentations, budgets + growth forecasts, and next steps.

### What is the idea?

Umuzi seeks to close the experience gap that exists in South Africa’s labour market effectively and efficiently through our Experience Lab - a last-mile experience incubator. 

The Experience Lab will target marginalised youth with post-school tertiary education, assess their current skills and aptitude, and create personalised experience pathways and projects, initially for Full Stack Web Developers, to bolster their experience and accelerate their entry into the digital technology workforce. 

Further, for higher aptitude learners, the Experience Lab will provide access to “impact gigs” - smaller, but meaningful freelance earning opportunities. These impact gigs not only expedite the typically long and costly job search process, but also help learners get one step closer to securing long-term employment opportunities that are aligned to their career aspirations. 

By meeting marginalised skilled youth where they are with tailored experience opportunities, we can equip and empower learners with relevant experience to secure the job they want - ultimately establishing careers where they can grow and thrive. 

The Experience Lab is underpinned by our XP Accelerator Hub - a data platform that leverages learner insights from assessments to effectively and efficiently link learners to customised experience projects or impact gigs. Once learners have completed their experience projects or impact gigs, their Learner Profile CV is updated and they are pushed through to our Partners Connection Portal, supported by our dedicated Placements team who use machine learning to efficiently place available talent to either impact gigs or open earning opportunities that are aggregated from partner channels. The XP Accelerator Hub also tracks learners' progression through their experience pathways and onto the earning opportunities and beyond - ultimately to track the long-term impact of the Experience Lab over time. Finally, the XP Accelerator Hub generates data insights and reports to showcase the impact for funders, partners, and learners themselves.

### Why is it valuable?

Resources to showcase the Experience Lab:
- Overview of the Experience Lab 
- Umuzi Beats Presentation (presented to the team on 26/10)
- Corporate Partner Presentation (to be amended depending on partner needs)
- Meeting the ICT Skills Demand in South Africa: A Case for Umuzi’s Experience Lab
- First draft of a potential XL thought leadership piece  

### Type of learner / target market for the Experience Lab

The target market of the Experience Lab are marginalised youth between the ages of 18 and 35 who have acquired some level of digital skills (post-secondary school education (i.e. diploma, degree, or certificates)).

Additionally, please see Annexure E from the IDC Draft Grant Agreement:
- **Learner contracts:** Action: Need to finalise the learner contract for the Experience Lab (currently with Rivo and Teddy for SAP but this will need to be done more broadly by Liezel).

## 2. Project Management

### Tracking our progress

**Monday.com**  
We now use the following MOM Workspace for XPL, with a variety of boards therein mapped out and detailed in this XPL MOM Map MOM board. This Workspace is where XPL is run.

For historical context, we used to use the following Monday board to track our progress. There are various boards in this space:
- **Mission Critical Next Steps:** highlighting the bite-size pieces of work to be completed to get started with the implementation of the Experience Lab. This is the main board being utilised by the teams.
- **Implementation Plan:** this follows our implementation plan ("Annexure 8" as submitted to the IDC). This needs to be updated with new dates; however, this board is not being utilised.
- **PR Agencies:** highlighting the various PR agencies we contacted for the PR launch campaign of the Experience Lab.
- **XL Sprints:** which can be used for teams wanting to break down their projects into two-week sprints.
- **Ideas and Risk Log.**

**Excel / Implementation Plan / Annexure 8**  
We also have an Excel version of our Implementation Plan (Annexure 8 Grant Agreement) that we have been updating and forms part of our Conditions Precedent Documents. This has been updated for a Feb 15th start date but will need to be amended for indicators and depending on if there are updated timelines.

- **Mission Critical Next Steps:** We also created this Mural on Mission critical next steps (constellations) breaking down chunks of work for implementation.
- We also created this Mission Critical PPT document to help visualise our progress.

### Weekly update meeting

We have a Weekly XL Update Meeting every Monday 14h30-15h30, where we raise blockers, challenges, important information, and often run through the Mission Critical Board. We use this space on Mural to raise agenda items (please scroll all the way to the right for the latest updates).

## 3. Finances, budget + indicators

### Finances

Here you can find a Tracking spreadsheet of Budget versus Actuals.

**Budget resources:**  
Please see the latest version of the budget which includes:
1. **IDC Funding Schedule:** An overview of when the IDC will pay us and over what period (total R25m; R15m 2025; R10m 2026). Please note this will likely change after signing the draft agreement.
   - Please see the latest drawdown schedule here as of 25.03.2025.
2. **Budget submitted:** This was the original budget submitted which was used to inform the funding schedule. Subsequently, we created a budget that redistributed staff costs slightly, with the overall budget remaining the same. These changes are reflected in spreadsheet 2b. Budget Hard Costs vs Shared Costs Columns D and F.
3. **Budget Hard Costs vs Shared Costs:** This spreadsheet sought to identify which budget expenses would be incurred only by the XL and which would be shared across Umuzi.
4. **Budget efficiencies (hard vs shared costs):** This is ultimately our working budget that should be utilised going forward for us to track costs, add costs, etc. It further takes into account the hard vs shared costs and creates efficiencies as shown from row 23 in the ‘Redistributed costs’ column (E, G, and I).
5. **External Income view:** was created should we need to present our matched funding and sustainability indicators to our stakeholders at the IDC.
6. **Internal income:** is a working sheet to help us track incoming funds available to be utilised for the Experience Lab.
7. **Salaries and Roles:** outlines the salaries and roles for funding years 1 and 2.

The remaining sheets speak to the funding partners we’ve reached out to and the possible funding available, including:
- TCX
- Oppenheimer
- DEDAT
- GenU
- SAP 
- Maria Marina

### Indicators

Indicators - please see this draft spreadsheet of indicators we will be measured on. (This needs to be updated according to the revised draft grant agreement which we are waiting on from the IDC).

**Action:** M&E to update indicators once the grant agreement has been signed; and work to include indicators in the project plan (Carly + Fiona). Previous indicators submitted for the DD day can be seen here.

## NPMN Technical Committee
