# Website Overhaul May 2025

A repository for all resources involved in the Website Overhaul.

## Context for Project

Since going remote in 2020 and expanding our global footprint, Umuzi has undergone a significant transformation. However, our current website hasn’t kept pace. It continues to reflect an outdated identity — positioning us solely as a South African NGO delivering learnerships. As a result, it no longer accurately represents who we are or the breadth of our work. Crucially, it fails to speak clearly to our key audiences:

- Primarily prospective partners, funders, and donors
- Secondarily prospective learners and team members
- The general public

In May 2025, we commenced with an overhaul of the website; herewith you can find associated resources.
