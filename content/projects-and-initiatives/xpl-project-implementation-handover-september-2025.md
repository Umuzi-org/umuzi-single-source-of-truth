## Relationships

### Recruitment

- **Current Status:** Aptitude Testing and Bootcamps are operational at scale. Still refining attraction approach for better-suited pipeline. Daena is the primary contact for most matters, while Demetri works directly with the databases and systems.
- **Next Steps:** Align on campaign timelines for the remaining 2025 Experience Lab cohorts.

### Launch Lab

- **Current Status:** The team has been working backwards from the 27 October start date with their team planning and activities, so priority is in the early stages of shifting to those that started with the Experience Lab on 29 April 2025. Siphelele is out of office for the next while, so Nduduzo is the primary contact for most matters.
- **Next Steps:** Iterate a v1 for the Launch Lab comprehensively supporting with external gigs (i.e. beyond placements) by drafting guides for the top platforms.

### Skills Lab

- **Current Status:** Documentation of Skills-Lab-managed modules as support services for Experience Lab has been updated for current technical pathways offered, with this being an ongoing need as the technical content diversifies. However, tracking lives across platforms and so would require the Salesforce build for full integration with our centralized databases. Matthew is the primary contact for most matters, while Kennedy works directly with the databases and systems.
- **Next Steps:** Confirm SOP guides (beyond timelines) for Skills Lab team downloading data for the Experience Lab Team to then request the Data Team integrate and contextualize against our centralized databases for monthly data pulls.

### Finance

- **Current Status:** Payouts for Maria Marina funds associated with Experience Lab gigs are motivating the migration to a new platform for this service. Refinement of the calculation of Impact Indicators 1 and 2 is needed given the distinction made in our reporting between opportunities and support services. Upcoming reporting period aligns with next drawdown period. Mitchell is the primary contact for most matters, while Hloni has historical knowledge and provides high-level internal operations oversight and support.
- **Next Steps:** Plot the timelines for when Finance will need to affect payments against the experience block and gig start and completion timelines respectively.

### Community

- **Current Status:** Missing Community elements and sentiment of Experience Lab identified and collaborated on with Recruitment in a common effort to refine the Experience Lab's attraction approach for better-suited pipeline. Mutinta is the primary contact for most matters, while Letsiwe has proactively supported Experience Lab directly with the explorers and continues to be engaged through Circle and the like.
- **Next Steps:** Link up Natalie and Letsiwe for cross-functional collaboration on explorer communications, support, and progression into and through the experience blocks.

### Tech and Data

- **Current Status:** Earning opportunity and support services briefed, pulled, revised, and now strategized around by the Data Team. Primary support remains with Retool (e.g. via requests and dashboard) while granular, longer-term builds sit with Salesforce, although this balance will have shifted slightly by the time of the December 2025 IDC report. Sara is the primary contact for most Tech matters, like our Salesforce build and database infrastructure, while Samantha is the primary contact for most Data matters, like earning opportunity and support service tracking, and Mark creates our specific queries in the databases.
- **Next Steps:** Sign off on complete list of earning opportunities and support services defined at appropriate level of granularity.

### Partnerships

- **Current Status:** Virtual handover meeting completed, in-person handover loading in Johannesburg soon led by Fiona. Outlined basic information flow from List of Participants to Cohort-aligned Forecast and then to Indicator Tracker, which now lives in the Master Data folder. Thandeka is the primary contact for most IDC matters, while Itumeleng traditionally works more closely with the learners.
- **Next Steps:** Thandeka and Itumeleng to review documentation transferred to them and reach out regarding any questions ahead of the in-person handover.
