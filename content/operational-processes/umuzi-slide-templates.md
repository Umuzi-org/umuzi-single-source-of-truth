# Umuzi Slide Templates

At Umuzi creating impactful presentations is key to unlocking success with our partners and funders.

We have created the following two presentations with slides that can be leveraged multiple times across teams and purposes, helping us to work faster through efficiencies, while maintaining consistency in our look and feel and a high standard of our outputs.

## These two presentations include:

### The Umuzi Organisational Deck

This deck includes slides that can be used to showcase:

- Who we are as Umuzi
- The challenges we're solving
- Our team and values
- Our offerings and solutions
- Case studies

### Our Umuzi slide template repository

This deck includes template slides that can be used for design inspiration for your own presentations. This includes slides for:

- Agendas
- Context
- Information
- Lists
- Team overviews
- Case Studies
- Processes
- Funnels
- Timelines
- Numbers
