# Work Jams

The intention of this ritual is to assist with two areas identified:

1. **Change of scenery:** Where a staff member needs a change of scenery and feels it would be beneficial to go work from a café / somewhere different where the staff member will be able to focus on getting work done (productivity booster).

2. **Human interaction:** Where a staff member would like some human interaction — they can reach out to other staff in the area and meet up — to discuss a project, work on a proposal together or just work near each other with chats over coffee or lunch.

## Guidelines

- All staff will be allowed a **R100 reimbursement** of expenses incurred while working from a café, per week. This can include:
  - Food & beverages
  - Tip
  - Transport costs (e.g. taxi)
- Slips will need to be submitted to Hloni for expenses incurred, up to R100 per week.
  - This can be done using this form.
- The café is not specified — staff are encouraged to choose any café that is most convenient to them.
- The reimbursement allowance **does not carry over**.

> **Note:** The intention is to get people connecting / having a change of scenery. It is reimbursive — you must spend the money to get the reimbursement. You do not get an additional R100 per week if you don't spend it.
