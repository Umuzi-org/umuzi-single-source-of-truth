# All Hands

## What is an All Hands Meeting?

All Hands is a quarterly gathering where the entire organisation comes together to align on progress, share key updates, and celebrate our collective achievements. It's a critical opportunity for all of us to get on the same page, stay connected to our company goals, and ensure transparency across teams.

## Goal of All Hands

- Create line of sight for all staff on what the organisation is doing and where we're headed
- Encourage knowledge sharing between teams
- Build a stronger sense of collective direction and transparency

## What Happens During the Meeting?

### Team Updates

Each team shares a high-level overview of their area of the business using a shared slide deck. This is your chance to showcase your team's progress, key wins, and any challenges.

**What to Share?**

Focus on the most important updates in your space—big wins, upcoming goals, challenges, or anything you think the whole crew needs to know.

Ask yourself:
*"What does the rest of the org need to hear from us?"* 🎯

### Strategic Alignment

Leaders provide updates on company-wide strategy, goals, and priorities for the next quarter.

### Celebrating Wins

We recognise individuals and teams who have gone above and beyond, celebrating milestones and reinforcing our core values.

### Open Floor

The meeting usually ends with a Q&A session or discussion time to foster collaboration and answer any questions.

## Who Leads the Meeting?

Our **Exco Members** are responsible for leading the All Hands Meeting. As team representatives, they ensure updates are prepared, meaningful, and aligned with the organisation's goals.

> **Pro Tip:** Include your team members in the presentation, especially junior staff. This is a great opportunity to give them exposure, build their confidence, and bring diverse voices to the table. Let's make sure this meeting isn't just about hearing from managers!

## Why It Matters

All Hands is more than just an update—it's about fostering connection and community in a remote-first organisation.

It's a moment to see the bigger picture, feel part of something impactful, and align our efforts as one team.

See you at the next All Hands! 🎉
