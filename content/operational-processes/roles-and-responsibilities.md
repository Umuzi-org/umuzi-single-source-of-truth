# Roles & Responsibilities: Using RACI

## What is RACI?

RACI is a responsibility assignment framework that clarifies roles in projects and processes. It helps ensure accountability, streamline decision-making, and prevent confusion.

### RACI Definitions

| Letter | Role | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **R** | Responsible | The person(s) who do the work to complete the task or deliverable. |
| **A** | Accountable | The person who is ultimately answerable for the task's success. *(Only one per task.)* |
| **C** | Consulted | People whose input is required before the task is completed. |
| **I** | Informed | People who need updates but do not actively contribute. |
