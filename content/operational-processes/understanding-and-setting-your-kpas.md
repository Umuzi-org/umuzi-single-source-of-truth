# Individual: Understanding and Setting Your KPAs

At Umuzi, KPAs (Key Performance Agreements) help us align our individual work with the bigger goals of our teams and the organisation. They're not just targets. They're tools for growth, clarity, and accountability.

This guide will help you understand what KPAs are, how to prepare for your KPA discussions, and how to get the most value out of them.

## Why KPAs Matter

KPAs are here to help you:

- Understand what success looks like in your role
- See how your work contributes to Umuzi's bigger objectives
- Grow your skills and impact through clear, achievable goals
- Have open, ongoing conversations about your development

## Getting Ready for Your KPA Discussion

Before meeting with your manager, take a bit of time to reflect on:

- **Your role and responsibilities:** What are the main outcomes you're accountable for?
- **Your strengths and growth areas:** Where do you want to stretch or improve?
- **How you contribute:** How does your work connect to your team's and Umuzi's objectives?

## Setting Clear and Achievable KPAs

During your KPA meeting, you and your manager will agree on goals that are meaningful and measurable.

Good KPAs are **SMART**:

- **S**pecific – clearly defined and focused
- **M**easurable – success can be tracked
- **A**chievable – realistic given your capacity and role
- **R**elevant – linked to your team and Umuzi's goals
- **T**ime-bound – includes a clear deadline or timeline

You'll also have the chance to share your own ideas and priorities. The more ownership you take, the more useful your KPAs will be.

## Collaborating with Your Manager

Think of this as a two-way conversation — not a checklist.

**Your manager's role is to:**

- Share context on Umuzi's and the team's goals
- Help define what success looks like for your role
- Offer support, guidance, and resources to help you achieve your KPAs

**Your role is to:**

- Share your input and perspective
- Ask for clarity or support where needed
- Take ownership of your goals and progress

## Setting Yourself Up for Success

Once your KPAs are agreed upon:

- **Make sure they're documented** — Currently we are using a template in Google Sheets. You and your manager have access to this sheet as well as Chief of Staff for visibility.
- **Know your checkpoints** — Regular reviews (monthly, quarterly, or biannual) help track progress.
- **Ask for what you need** — Tools, training, and feedback are all part of the process.

> KPAs are meant to guide you — not to box you in.

## Reviewing and Adjusting

You'll review your KPAs regularly with your manager.

During these check-ins:

- Celebrate what's going well
- Discuss challenges or changes
- Adjust goals if needed (especially if Umuzi's priorities or your projects shift)

It's normal for KPAs to evolve as work and priorities change.

## If You're Struggling to Meet Your KPAs

If you're finding it hard to meet your goals:

- **Talk to your manager early.** It is okay to ask for help.
- **Identify what's getting in the way** (resources, clarity, training, etc.)
- **Revisit the goals together** to make sure they're still realistic and aligned.

> **Tip:** Growth comes from reflection and adjustment. Not perfection.

## Continuous Feedback and Growth

Your KPA journey doesn't end once goals are set. You'll have ongoing opportunities to:

- Get feedback and celebrate achievements
- Learn from challenges
- Build skills and confidence through coaching, training, or mentorship

> **Remember:** KPAs are about clarity, connection, and growth. They help you see how your contribution matters and how Umuzi can support you to do your best work.
