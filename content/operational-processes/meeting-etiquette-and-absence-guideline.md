# Meeting Etiquette and Absence Guidelines

This policy can help promote professionalism and effective communication during meetings, as well as provide a framework for addressing situations when participants cannot attend as planned.

## Guidelines

1. **Notify the Organizer:** As soon as you realize you won't be able to attend, promptly inform the meeting organizer and your direct manager. This allows them to make any necessary adjustments. You can send an email or message, or make a phone call if it's last-minute. Be sure to use a subject line that clearly indicates the purpose of the message, such as *"Meeting Absence - [Date and Time]."*

2. **Provide a Reason:** Briefly explain why you can't attend. You don't need to go into great detail, but a general reason helps the organizer understand the situation. For example, you might mention a conflicting appointment, a personal matter, or an unexpected emergency.

3. **Propose an Alternative if Possible:** If the meeting is important and you can suggest an alternative, such as a different time or date, it can be a helpful gesture. Make sure to coordinate this with the organizer and other attendees to find a mutually convenient time.

4. **Designate an Alternate if Appropriate:** If your presence is crucial, consider designating a colleague or team member as your alternate to attend in your place. Brief them on the meeting's agenda and key points, and provide them with any necessary documents or information.

5. **Prepare Meeting Materials:** If you were expected to present or provide input during the meeting, prepare your materials in advance and share them with the organizer or attendees, if possible. This ensures that your input is not entirely missed.

6. **Follow Up:** After the meeting, reach out to the organizer or attendees to get a summary of what was discussed and any action items. This will help you stay informed and ensure that you're up to date with the meeting's outcomes.

7. **Apologize and Show Appreciation:** Express your regret for missing the meeting and thank the organizer and participants for their understanding and flexibility. This shows professionalism and courtesy.

8. **Learn from the Experience:** If your absence from meetings becomes a recurring issue, take steps to address the root causes and find ways to minimize future disruptions to your schedule.
