# Staff: Get to Know Me Sessions

## What are "Get to Know Me" Sessions?

Working remotely means we don't always get to share those casual coffee chats or spontaneous office moments that help us truly get to know each other. These sessions create space for us to connect beyond our screens, learn about each other's journeys, and build a stronger, more supportive team.

It's amazing what we discover when we take a moment to listen, whether it's a hidden talent, an inspiring story, or just a hilarious fun fact. Every teammate has a story worth sharing, and this is our way of celebrating that.

Once a month, a mystery guest is chosen, and the team keeps throwing guesses to the Team WhatsApp group leading up to the big reveal on Friday. It's a chance to learn about our teammates in a way that goes beyond job titles and tasks.

## Why We Do This

- Strengthen connections within the team 💙
- For us to learn and connect beyond job roles and titles
- Create a fun, engaging space to share experiences

## Session Format + Cadence

- **Duration + Cadence:** 30–45 minutes, once a month
- **Guest:** A different team member each session
- **Host:** Heart Team member

## How it Works

### Step 1: Mystery Guest Selection (Monday–Tuesday)

A Heart team member reaches out to a team member in advance to schedule and invite them to be the week's Mystery Guest.

The mystery guest provides **one teaser clue** about themselves. This could be:

- 📸 A baby picture (cute or embarrassing, your choice!)
- 🎵 A favourite song (a banger from your playlist that a teammate might know you like)
- 🎬 A favourite movie line/quote (deep or hilarious, all up to you)
- 🤔 A fun fact — Did you once meet Beyoncé? Can you solve a Rubik's cube in under a minute?

### Step 2: Teaser Sent to the Team (Wednesday)

A Heart team member then posts the teaser clue to the team WhatsApp Group.

Guesses are shared in the group throughout the week. Wrong answers are always welcome. 😄

### Step 3: The Big Reveal & Session (Friday)

📅 Google Meets, 30-Min Session @ 10 am.
