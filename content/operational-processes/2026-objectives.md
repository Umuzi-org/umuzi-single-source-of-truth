# 2026 Objectives

This page outlines how we'll work together to make progress on Umuzi's 2026 goals. It also links you to key resources and boards to help your team plan, track, and share your work throughout the year.

## 2026 Organisational Objectives

Our organisational objectives should guide all the work we do in 2026. They help us focus our energy, align across teams, and measure our impact.

## 2026 Planning & Execution Process

To make sure we're working in sync and building momentum throughout the year, here's how the 2026 cycle will run:

### 1. Plan (November–December 2025)

During November and December, each team will:

- Review the 2026 organisational objectives
- Identify team strategies, projects, and initiatives that directly support these objectives
- Capture all projects and initiatives on the 2026 Monday.com board for visibility and tracking
- Add your team's projects and initiatives to the 2026 Monday.com board

*(For reference, you can view the 2025 Monday.com board here)*

This early planning helps us start 2026 with clarity and shared direction.

### 2. Present (January 2026)

At the start of the year, teams will present their 2026 strategies, projects, and initiatives to the CEO.

These presentations are a chance to:

- Show alignment with organisational objectives
- Clarify team priorities and focus areas
- Get feedback and support before implementation begins

### 3. Track Progress (Ongoing)

Each team is responsible for regular team check-ins to review progress, challenges, and updates on projects linked to the organisational objectives.

> See the guide for running team check-ins on Slab

These check-ins keep everyone aligned and help us surface wins, blockers, and support needs early.

### 4. Reflect & Reset (Mid-Year 2026)

In mid-2026, teams will pause to reflect on progress:

- What's working well?
- What needs to change or pivot?
- How are we tracking against our objectives?

This is our chance to celebrate progress, refocus, and reset for the second half of the year.

### 5. Close Off & Plan Ahead (End of Year 2026)

At the end of 2026, teams will:

- Wrap up final reflections
- Share outcomes and learnings
- Begin planning for 2027 based on insights and results from the year

## Why This Matters

This process helps us:

- Stay aligned across all teams
- Make our work and impact visible
- Build accountability and transparency
- Continuously improve how we plan and deliver

Let's make 2026 a year of clarity, collaboration, and measurable impact.
