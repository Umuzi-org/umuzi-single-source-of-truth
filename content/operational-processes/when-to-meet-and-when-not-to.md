# Async vs. Synchronous: When to Meet and When Not To

## What's the Difference?

- **Synchronous Communication** happens in real-time, like meetings, calls, and live chats/huddles.
- **Asynchronous Communication** happens on your own time, like emails, recorded videos, and shared docs.

Both have their place, but knowing when to use each can save time, increase productivity, and reduce meeting fatigue.

## When to Use Asynchronous Communication

Use async when:

- ✅ You don't need an immediate response
- ✅ The topic requires deep thinking, research, or documentation
- ✅ Participants are in different time zones
- ✅ A written update or recorded video is just as effective as a live discussion
- ✅ You need a referenceable record of the conversation
- ✅ You want to avoid unnecessary disruptions to focused work

**Examples of Async Communication:**

- Sharing project updates in a document or Slack thread
- Recording a short video to explain something complex
- Asking for feedback via comments in a shared doc
- Sending decisions or key takeaways in an email

## When to Use Synchronous Communication (Meetings, Calls, Live Chats)

Use synchronous when:

- ✅ The discussion requires real-time collaboration and back-and-forth conversation
- ✅ There are complex decisions to be made with multiple perspectives
- ✅ The topic is sensitive and needs a human touch
- ✅ Brainstorming or problem-solving is more effective live
- ✅ You need to build relationships and team connection
- ✅ The topic is urgent and requires immediate alignment

**Examples of When to Meet:**

- Weekly team check-ins, Operational Leadership Forum and All Hands meetings
- Strategic planning sessions
- Conflict resolution or sensitive discussions
- Workshops and collaborative problem-solving
- Performance reviews and feedback sessions

## Making the Right Call: Async or Sync?

Before scheduling a meeting, ask yourself:

1. Can this be done in an email, Slack thread, or shared doc instead?
2. Do we need immediate back-and-forth conversation?
3. Will async allow for better thoughtfulness and participation?
4. Are all participants available at the same time, or will time zones be a challenge?

If a meeting is truly needed, keep it efficient:

- 🔹 Set a clear agenda
- 🔹 Invite only necessary people
- 🔹 Keep it as short as possible
- 🔹 End with clear action items
- 🔹 Share notes afterward for those who couldn't attend

By being intentional about when to meet and when to use async, we can create a more productive, thoughtful, and focused work environment. 🚀
