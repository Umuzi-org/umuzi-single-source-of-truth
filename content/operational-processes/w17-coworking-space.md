# Workshop17 Co-Working Space

## Background

As a fully remote organisation, we recognise the need for intentional collaboration between team members. We also understand that sometimes, working from a different location is necessary—whether due to work travel, the need for focused time away from home distractions, or temporary office challenges such as load-shedding.

To support our team, we have partnered with **Workshop17**, providing access to their national co-working spaces.

## Access & Set-up

All full-time Umuzi team members have access to Workshop17 co-working spaces. You should have received a welcome email with your login details from **my@mg.workshop17.co.za** with the subject line *"Welcome to Workshop17"*.

**To activate your access:**

1. Update your details on the my.Workshop17 platform
2. Download the W17 App and log in using your my.workshop17 credentials
3. Use the self-check-in system on the app when arriving and leaving the space

## Using the Space

### Hot-Desking

Hot-desking is available with two billing options:

| Option | Duration | Credits |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Half Day | Up to 4 hours | 1.5 space credits |
| Full Day | Beyond 4 hours | 2.5 space credits |

**Guidelines:**

- Plan your day effectively when using hot-desking to maximise productivity.
- Be mindful of others in the shared space.
- Familiarise yourself with the basic co-working space rules (See the "Member's How-To Guide").

> **No Pre-Authorisation is Required.** However, please inform your manager and complete this form so we can track usage and ensure the space benefits your workday.

### Avoiding Billing Issues

To avoid incorrect check-ins, **do not allow W17-Secure WiFi to connect automatically** on your electronic devices (update the connection details accordingly in your settings) as this will automatically check you in when you connect to the W17-Secure WiFi — i.e. having a drink in the WiFi vicinity with friends, or even just walking/driving past.

## Booking Meeting Rooms

Meeting Rooms (boardroom, conference room, consulting room) require **pre-authorisation at least 30 hours in advance**. To request a booking, complete the Workshop 17 Booking Form.

**Required Details:**

- **Who** is requesting the meeting room?
- **Purpose** for requesting the meeting room (this is needed to allocate the meeting room cost to the correct cost centre).
- **Number of people** meeting (rooms come in various sizes — seats in the room).
- **Resources needed** in the meeting room, e.g., a display screen or no display screen. If you require basic stationery, e.g., the use of a whiteboard, please advise reception upon arrival.
- **Start time** — you must start on time as we are billed per 30-minute slots, so do not book 08h30 start when you know the team will arrive at 09h15.
- **End time** — being a co-working space, meeting spaces are shared with other users.

> ⚠️ **Cancellation is NOT permitted 25 hours before the start of the event** — this is the Workshop17 Rule. Umuzi will be liable for the entire booking, and Umuzi reserves the right to pass the cost to the meeting owner/organiser.

### Which Meeting Room Am I In?

You'll get an email from Workshop17 with the subject line: *"Booking Appointment at [name of the W17 location you booked]"*. This email will include the details of your exact meeting room.

## Parking

Due to the creative nature of the location of the various Workshop17 sites, there is no "one size fits all" with regards to parking. Some sites are located in malls (so you use the mall parking), others are located in corporate buildings (and thus there is controlled access parking). It's therefore important that you **familiarise yourself with the parking logistics** if/when you are driving to site.

- It is your responsibility to settle the parking invoice and you can submit a claim via the claims form if you wish to claim.
- Workshop17 sells pre-validated parking tickets — these usually are a flat rate (i.e. they cover parking for up to 8 hours). They therefore can be less economical when one is in co-working space for less time.
- It is **your responsibility** to ensure the best payment method is chosen (i.e. pay at the exit or purchase a pre-validated ticket).
