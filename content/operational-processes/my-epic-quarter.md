# My Epic Quarter

## What is "My Epic Quarter"?

"My Epic Quarter" is an initiative designed to help each team member showcase the work they are most proud of every quarter. It's an opportunity to reflect on achievements, take ownership of contributions, and enhance presentation skills in a supportive environment.

During the first three quarters of the year, every team will prepare a slide deck called "My Epic Quarter."

## Why Are We Doing This?

- **Showcasing Achievements:** Gives everyone a platform to highlight the work they are proud of and share their impact.
- **Encouraging Reflection:** Helps individuals recognise their progress and areas for growth.
- **Building Accountability:** Reinforces a culture of ownership and transparency.
- **Practicing Presentation Skills:** Develops confidence in communicating work effectively.
- **Inspiring Excellence:** Seeing what others have accomplished may spark motivation and ambition.

## How It Works

- Every quarter, each person prepares a concise slide deck showcasing their personal achievements.
- Presentations focus on what **YOU** specifically have accomplished that quarter.
- Presentations will happen within teams, with Exco invited to attend these sessions.
- The best and most impactful presentations will be shared more widely across the organisation to recognize exceptional work.
