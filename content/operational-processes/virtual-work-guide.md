# Virtual Work Guide

## Description + Context

Moving from an in-office environment to a completely virtual environment has presented some challenges regarding working habits, particularly for more junior employees. We are of the opinion that these staff members require slightly more guidance, frameworks and containers to assist them in honing their skills and habits that will set them up for success in any professional work environment. This document details some of those guidelines.

## Good Virtual Work Habits

### How You Structure Your Work Day

**Your contract and work hours:**

The standard Umuzi contract states that an employee will work from 08h30–17h30 with an hour lunch break every day. Although we are in no way clock watchers and we believe in outcome and output over seeing bums in seats, this comes to a **40 hour work week**.

Now we understand that a virtual environment presents its own challenges with parents asking to be taken to doctor's appointments and siblings needing help with homework. Therefore, we are flexible in how you choose to get your 40 hours in, in a week. Here are some guidelines around that:

- Should a personal matter arise, for example, on a Tuesday at 2:30pm and this prevents you from doing any further work on that day, you've missed out on 3 hours of work.
- You will need to let your manager know.
- To balance your week again, you can now make up those 3 hours by working 1 additional hour on the following 3 days, making up for the work time that was lost.
- Does this mean that you've now worked overtime? **No**, because your total hours worked this week will remain 40 hours.

**Some ideas to help you stay on track:**

- Keep some kind of diary — play around to see what kind of task management system works for you: digital, analogue, an app of some kind.
- If you're finding it hard to know whether you're over working, under working or getting it just right, why don't you do a little experiment: track the amount of time that you spend working every day for a week and see what it adds up to. The results may surprise you.

**Your work environment set up:**

Now that we're all working from home, it may be obvious but you will require:

- A quiet area where you can focus on your work
- A background that is appropriate for professional meetings — your messy room and unmade bed are probably not going to leave the best impression 😉
- A reliable internet and electricity connection as far as that is something that is under your control. If you know that where you live, the internet is unreliable and you frequently experience load shedding, then you are going to struggle to get your work done and we highly recommend you try to find alternative work spaces.

## Communication

The importance of mastering this soft essential skill for your own career success cannot be overstated. Different divisions and departments will communicate differently but there are some common themes that will take you a long way.

### Communication Channels

Umuzi has various communication channels/platforms that we expect people to stay on top of. These include:

- **Slab**
- **Email**
- **WhatsApp**

To prevent you from constantly task switching, it may be a good idea to have set periods where you check comms e.g. first thing as you start work, at lunch and just before ending your day. This way, you can focus on getting work done instead of getting distracted by little noises every 5 seconds but the greatest delay someone will have in hearing from you will be max a couple of hours.

> Why not try your best to have a **12-hour or max 24-hour response time**, meaning that you commit to getting back to anyone who contacts you using whatever channel within 24 hours. This response could just be to say that you're working on it and will let the person know once you have more concrete feedback.

### Acknowledging Comms

If you receive a message or if there is a general comm that goes out and you are an intended recipient (e.g. someone who is meant to be receiving the comm) then you either need to **reply to the message**, where necessary, or **react with an emoji**. This is to acknowledge that you've seen the message.

### Public Communication

**When it affects the team:** communicate where the whole team can see it. Where possible, communicate challenges like loadshedding or connection issues on a public channel (e.g. Slack #general) so that the whole team is aware of the issue and there is no broken telephone.

### Other Considerations

- Try to organise stand-ins for duties you will not be able to perform.
- When taking leave, communicate with your coworkers to organise stand-ins for events.
- Communicate publicly who will be doing what so that the team is not in the dark and confused while you are away.
- When you need help but don't know who to ask, **ask publicly**. Your team members can tag someone that is able to help or offer help themselves.
- If the issue is of a personal nature and you don't feel comfortable posting to a public platform, then of course rather go straight to your manager.

### E-mails

You are working in a professional environment — you need to use professional business language in your e-mails. Some guidance:

- Keep it as short and to the point as possible — people stop reading when an email is longer than necessary.
- Write in full sentences with full words. E.g. Txt language is **not** OK.

### Phone Calls

If this is something that is second nature to you and you've got it down, then great! If not, here are some guidelines:

- If it's a business call, start by identifying yourself: *"Hi, this is Anele"* and then go into the details.
- We have diaries that are open for a reason: if possible, check to see that the person's diary is open before calling, or message to ask if they have time to chat at some point and ask what time works for them.

## Meetings

- Where possible, send your meeting request **at least 1 day in advance**.
- **Avoid double booking** — everyone's calendars are visible for this reason.
- **Respond to calendar invites** as soon as you see them, so that others can plan their time effectively.
- If you responded "yes" but something changes (e.g. no electricity), let the meeting host know in advance that you can't make it (and explain why).
- Check your calendar the night before or early in the morning to be able to plan your day effectively.
- **PREP for every meeting!** If anything is sent to you in advance, go through it. If you know that the meeting will use some sort of tech (e.g. Mural) then make sure you have access etc.
- Ensure you have a **working microphone** so that you can join in on the discussion.

### A Word on Your Professional "Brand"

**Out of sight, out of mind:** if you're wanting to accelerate your career, you need to be noticed. One way of doing this is by focusing on the fact that you are a professional brand. If you want to build your brand as someone who is a competent team player — then **participate in the meetings you're in!**

If you can, **turn your camera on**: there are plenty of studies that say people trust you more when they can see you!

### Daily Stand-ups

Stand-ups are an important tool for us to communicate and coordinate. To have effective stand-ups, it's a good idea to:

- Prepare for your stand-up in advance — by the time you get to stand-up you should have a rough plan for your day prepared.
- Communicate what you need:
  - Reviews
  - Help
  - Blockers
- Communicate and take note of your colleagues' plans.
- If your plans are going to collide, stand-up is the time to address this.
- If you know you will be absent, send your plan in advance.
- If you are unable to send it in advance, send it as soon as you come online.
