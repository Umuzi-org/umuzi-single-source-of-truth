# No Meeting Wednesday

Meetings are essential for alignment and collaboration, but they can often eat into our time for deep, productive work. So, we introduced **No Meeting Wednesday**—a simple yet effective way to protect one day a week for uninterrupted focus.

## What is No Meeting Wednesday?

No Meeting Wednesday is a practice where we:

- **Avoid scheduling meetings** on Wednesdays unless absolutely necessary.
- **Dedicate the day to deep, focused work**, free from interruptions.
- **Use the time for purposeful collaboration**, like workshops or project planning.

This initiative helps us strike a balance between staying connected and getting meaningful work done.

## Why No Meeting Wednesday?

- **Boost Productivity:** Meetings can disrupt flow and reduce the time available for essential work. This dedicated day allows you to fully immerse in tasks that require your attention.
- **Enhance Collaboration:** Use Wednesdays for intentional teamwork—workshops, problem-solving sessions, or brainstorming with colleagues.
- **Encourage Focus:** Protecting this time helps build momentum, tackle big projects, and reduce stress.

## How to Make the Most of It

1. **Avoid Scheduling Meetings:** Unless absolutely critical, hold off on scheduling any meetings on Wednesdays.
2. **Plan Ahead:** Use this day to dive into tasks that require focus or are hard to prioritise on other days.
3. **Be Intentional:** While meetings are discouraged, workshops or collaborative sessions on specific goals are welcome. Use this as a day to work smarter.

## Quick Guidelines

- Do not schedule recurring meetings on Wednesdays.
- Respect others' time and use this day as a productivity boost for yourself and your team.
- Need to meet? Ask yourself: *"Is it urgent, or can it wait until tomorrow?"*
