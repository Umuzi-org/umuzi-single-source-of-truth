## What is Inside Track?

Your weekly Umuzi update from Internal Ops & Community Team

Inside Track is a short, simple update shared every Monday on Slack and WhatsApp.

It's designed to help everyone start the week aligned, connected, and "in the loop" without being overwhelmed by scattered messages.

## What You'll Find Inside

Each edition includes:

- Who's In & Out – who's on leave or away this week
- What's On – important meetings, events, and deadlines
- Connect & Engage – connection sessions and community highlights
- Policy or Process Spotlight – quick awareness of key policies or tools
- Quick Tip – a useful tip, resource, or kudos shout-out

We keep it short, visual, and easy to scan — so you get what you need in under two minutes.
