# Managers: Setting and Discussing KPAs with Team Members

This guide is designed to assist managers in setting meaningful KPAs (Key Performance Agreement) for their team members and fostering productive discussions around these goals.

## Tips for Productive KPA Discussions

- **Open Dialogue:** Create a comfortable environment for team members to voice concerns or suggestions.
- **Focus on Growth:** Frame KPAs as opportunities for development rather than punitive measures.
- **Keep the Big Picture in Mind:** Remind team members how their KPAs fit into the larger goals of the team and Umuzi.
- **Offer Support, Not Just Targets:** Encourage team members by discussing how you'll support them in achieving their KPAs.

## 1. Preparing for the KPA Setting Process

Before meeting with your team members, ensure you have a clear understanding of the following:

- **Umuzi Objectives:** View Umuzi 2025 Objectives here
- **Team Member Roles:** A thorough understanding of each team member's responsibilities and how their work contributes to the overall success of the team. See Umuzi Job Descriptions
- **KPAs for the Role:** Predefine measurable goals specific to the role, reflecting outputs and outcomes relevant to their work.

## 2. The KPA Discussion: Setting Clear Expectations

When meeting with team members to set KPAs, structure the conversation using the following steps:

### a. Discuss the Importance of KPAs

- **Purpose:** Explain that KPAs help in aligning their work with Umuzi's objectives and provide a clear measure of success.
- **Impact:** Highlight how meeting KPAs positively affects the team, department, and Umuzi's goals.

### b. Set Context with Organisational and Team Objectives

- **Umuzi Objectives:** Share the broader Umuzi objectives and how your team is contributing to these.
- **Team Objectives:** Explain how the team's objectives are aligned with the larger Umuzi vision.

### c. Define Clear, Achievable KPAs

- **SMART Goals:** Ensure that the KPAs are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.
- **Tailor KPAs to the Role:** Ensure KPAs reflect the team member's specific responsibilities and areas of influence.

### d. Collaborate on KPAs

- **Engage the Team Member:** Encourage the team member to share their thoughts and suggestions about the KPAs, allowing them to feel ownership and accountability.
- **Feedback:** Incorporate any reasonable feedback from the team member, ensuring mutual agreement on the KPAs.

> It's absolutely essential for goals to be accepted.

## 3. Setting the Path for Success

### a. Identify Resources and Support Needed

- **Tools and Training:** Ask the team member if they require any additional resources (e.g., tools, software, or training) to achieve their KPAs.
- **Obstacles:** Discuss potential challenges and how they can be mitigated.

### b. Establish Checkpoints and Review Periods

- **Regular Check-ins:** Set up a regular review schedule (e.g., monthly or quarterly) to track progress and provide support.
- **Adjust as Necessary:** Be flexible and open to revisiting KPAs if Umuzi's priorities shift or challenges arise.

## 4. After the Meeting: Document and Track

### a. Document the Agreed KPAs

- Use performance management systems (e.g., SageHR, Monday.com, Google Sheet/Excel) to record the agreed-upon KPIs, timelines, and metrics.
- Share the documented KPAs with the team member for transparency and mutual accountability.

### b. Set up Regular Checkpoints

- Schedule meetings in your calendar to review progress at defined intervals. Use this time to assess performance, offer guidance, and discuss any needed adjustments.

### c. Provide Ongoing Feedback

- **Offer Praise and Guidance:** Regularly acknowledge successes and guide improvements where necessary.
- **Be Proactive:** Address any potential shortfalls early and provide constructive feedback on how to get back on track.

## 5. Handling Challenges in Achieving KPAs

### a. Address Performance Gaps

- **Discuss Challenges:** If the team member is struggling to meet their KPAs, discuss the specific challenges they are facing.
- **Reassess Goals:** If necessary, adjust the KPAs based on new information or unexpected obstacles, keeping the goals reasonable but still challenging.

### b. Offer Development Opportunities

- **Skill Gaps:** Identify if further training or upskilling is needed.
- **Coaching:** Provide guidance, mentoring, or additional resources to help improve performance. See Counselling as Corrective Action.

## 6. Reviewing and Adjusting KPAs

### a. Regular Reviews

- Conduct periodic reviews to evaluate progress and adjust goals as needed.
- Ensure these reviews happen in alignment with Umuzi review cycles (biannually).

### b. Adjust KPAs Based on Performance or External Factors

- Be prepared to modify KPAs if there are changes in team responsibilities, project scope, or organisational objectives.
- Reassess timelines and goals if significant obstacles arise that are outside of the team member's control.

> **Remember:** The goal of KPAs is not just to measure performance but also to encourage growth, development, and a sense of purpose within your team.
