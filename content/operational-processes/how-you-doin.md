# "How You Doin" Staff Surveys

## Background: Evolving Our Staff Surveys

At Umuzi, we recognise that our strength comes from our dedicated and talented team. To foster a positive and productive work environment, we introduced quarterly staff surveys in 2024, building on the foundation laid by Andrew and Carly with the 2023 Team Happiness survey.

As we continue to refine our approach, we are transitioning to **biannual surveys** instead of quarterly check-ins. These surveys remain anonymous and are designed to capture insights into both personal workplace experiences and how well Umuzi embodies its core values. By shifting to a biannual format, we aim to provide more time for meaningful action on feedback while maintaining a strong connection with our team's sentiments.

## Purpose and Benefits

Our "How You Doin" staff surveys aligns with our strategic pillar: **Foster an engaged and aspirational community for learning and growth.**

This survey provides a structured way to gather regular feedback, ensuring that Umuzi remains dynamic, responsive, and aligned with both our mission and the needs of our team. By creating a continuous loop of feedback and improvement, we can cultivate a positive and productive work environment.
