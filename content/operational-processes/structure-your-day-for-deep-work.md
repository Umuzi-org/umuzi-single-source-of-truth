# How to Structure Your Day for Deep Work

Deep work is about engaging in focused, undistracted effort to produce high-quality results. Here's how to structure your day to make the most of it, especially on **No Meeting Wednesdays**:

## 1. Plan Ahead

- Identify your top 2–3 priorities for the day and list them in order of importance.
- Allocate dedicated time blocks to tackle these tasks.

## 2. Optimise Your Workspace

- Mute notifications on your phone and computer.
- Let colleagues know you're in a focused work session.

## 3. Use the Pomodoro Technique

- Work in **25-minute focused intervals** followed by **5-minute breaks**.
- After 4 cycles, take a longer break to recharge.

## 4. Schedule Administrative Tasks Wisely

- Handle emails, Slack messages, or other admin tasks in pre-set blocks to avoid constant distractions.

## 5. Reflect and Reset

- At the end of the day, review what you've accomplished and plan for tomorrow.

By structuring your day, you'll maximise productivity and ensure you're making the most of your time.
