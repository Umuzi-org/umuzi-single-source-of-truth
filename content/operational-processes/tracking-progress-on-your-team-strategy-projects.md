# Guideline: Tracking Progress on Your Team Strategy (Projects & Initiatives)

It's important to build an ongoing discipline around tracking, reflecting, and sharing progress throughout the year. Below are a few suggestions to help your team make this a consistent and meaningful part of your workflow.

## 1. Capture Your Team Strategy on MOM

Each team should have a clear, accessible place to view and update their Team Strategy, Projects and Initiatives.

**Suggested setup:**

- Create a team board within our shared 2026 Objectives workspace on Monday.com.
- Add objectives and corresponding key results as separate groups within the same board.

This helps ensure that everyone within your team and across Umuzi can see what you're focusing on and how progress is being measured.

## 2. Check-In Regularly

Regular check-ins are key to maintaining momentum, focus, and accountability. Each team should determine how frequently they want to meet to check-in on their OKRs.

**Suggested rhythm:**

- A fortnightly 30-minute meeting to check-in on OKRs.
- Nominate a team champion to coordinate and run these check-ins.

This rhythm ensures that strategy stays alive — not something set once a year, but something we keep working towards week by week.

## 3. Report Back and Reflect

Once a month, Team Leads share progress on their team's OKRs in the fortnightly **Operational Leadership Forum (OLF)**.

This creates organisational visibility, helps identify patterns across teams, and ensures support and alignment.

## 4. Bring Visibility to the Organisation

Transparency builds shared understanding and alignment. Bringing the rest of the organisation along in your team's progress helps everyone see how different pieces connect to Umuzi's overall goals.

**Ways to do this:**

- Use **All Hands meetings** to share updates, learnings, and highlights from your strategy work.
- Showcase key wins, insights, and pivots. This raises awareness of what's most important in your area and celebrates progress together.
