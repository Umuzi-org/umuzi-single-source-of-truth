# Umuzi OKRs

In late 2023 Umuzi began its OKR journey — one to create focus and alignment across the organisation as we grow and scale. This page provides an overview of this journey, with links to helpful resources.

## What are OKRs?

OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) are a goal-management methodology that help us to break down our long-term strategy into shorter term goals.

OKRs are used to create organisational alignment, focus and direction and to shift the needle of the business. OKRs are focused on **driving change** in the organisation (unlike KPIs which are focused on the health of the business and business-as-usual activities).

- **Objectives** = inspirational goal we set out to achieve
- **Key Results** = a quantitative way to measure the impact of the business

## Why Do We Use OKRs?

OKRs help us to put energy behind the important initiatives that will drive our business forward and transform it into the business of the future.

OKRs help to create focus, alignment, and accountability.

## Resources

For more on the detail behind OKRs please see the following resources:

- OKR cheat sheet
- Initial training presentation
- General OKR folder where all documents can be found

**Useful books to read:**

- *OKR Handbook* — Paul Niven
- *Measure What Matters* — John Doerr

## How Do We Use OKRs at Umuzi?

Deployment parameters are a helpful way for organisations to determine how they will use OKRs.

The following 'Deployment Parameters' document was put together when OKRs were re-invigorated in June 2024. This document should be revised once the approach for OKRs has been established for 2025.

### The OKR Cycle

The OKR cycle consists of the following processes:

1. **Formulating our OKRs** within working groups / pillars
2. **Checking-in on our OKRs** (fortnightly 30-minute sessions)
   - For more on running OKR check-ins see slides 18–19 of this presentation
   - Our OKR Monday board can be found here
3. **Reflecting + Resetting our OKRs** (at the end of each cycle)
   - Follow this link for an overview of these Reflect + Reset sessions

Going forward we believe that longer OKR cycles will be more beneficial to the team.

> For more learnings after our first cycle of OKRs please see this Mural brainstorming.

## Suggestions for Going Forward with Our KPIs and OKRs

Since December 2024, the teams have been busy setting their KPIs and OKRs for 2025. While the team is still busy setting these for 2025, we have included some suggestions on how we can create an ongoing discipline around them:

### Capturing KPIs and OKRs on Monday

- Each team could create a board within our OKR board to reflect their KPIs and OKRs for the year.
- It might be worthwhile having a group for KPIs which are measured across the year (and perhaps aligned to various horizons e.g. P0, P1, P2) with actions as sub-items.
- Objectives and their corresponding Key Results could be captured as separate groups within the same board on MOM.

### Checking-in on Our KPIs and OKRs

- Regular check-ins are key to driving momentum and accountability.
- Each team should determine how frequently they want to meet to check-in on their OKRs and KPIs.
- **Suggestion:** A fortnightly 30-minute meeting to check-in on OKRs, and then once a month extending one of these sessions to also track KPIs (which may typically be tracked over a longer time frame).
- Each team should nominate a champion to run these check-ins.
- Once a month team leads could also report back to Exco on their team's progress across OKRs and KPIs.

### Bringing Visibility to the Rest of the Organisation

- Bringing the rest of the organisation on the journey of these KPIs and OKRs will be important to ensure there is transparency.
- To do this we can leverage **All Hands meetings** to showcase learnings / strategy / action plan of each team to raise awareness of what the most important things are in their space.
