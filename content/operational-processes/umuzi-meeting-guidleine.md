# Umuzi Meeting Guideline

## Why This Matters

Meetings should be purposeful, efficient, and keep us aligned—without taking over our calendars. Fewer, better meetings mean more time for deep work.

Here's everything you need to know!

## Meeting Types

| Type | Description | Duration |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Huddles** | Quick updates or questions | 10–15 min |
| **Strategic Meetings** | Big-picture planning | 1–2 hrs |
| **Workshops/Ideation** | Brainstorming & problem-solving | As needed |
| **Operational Meetings** | Day-to-day progress | 30 min – 1 hr |
| **Team Meetings** | Project or department-focused | 30 min – 1 hr |
| **Ad-hoc Meetings** | Urgent matters | Keep it short |

## Roles & Responsibilities

- 🧑🏽‍💻 **Facilitator** – Keeps the meeting focused and on track
- 📝 **Note-Taker** – Captures key decisions & action items
- ⏰ **Timekeeper** – Ensures meetings don't run over
- 🧍🏽‍♂️ **Participants** – Show up prepared, stay engaged

## Before The Meeting

### Huddle Etiquette

💬 Huddles should be quick and focused—just give people a heads-up before starting one so you're not catching them off guard.

## Meeting Etiquette

**Platform:** All meetings will be on Google Meet unless an external partner requires a different tool.

**Be on time** – Start and end as scheduled.

**Stay focused** – Meetings should be purposeful, respectful, and inclusive. Everyone should have a chance to contribute.

### What's Expected

- ✅ **Know why you're there** – If unsure, ask. 🤷‍♂️
- ✅ **Turn your camera on** – Unless agreed otherwise.
- ✅ **Check your setup** – Stable internet, working audio/video. If loadshedding or poor connection is a frequent issue, find an alternative workspace.
- ✅ **Limit distractions** – Quiet space, clean background (blur if needed).
- ✅ **Dress appropriately** – No PJs, offensive graphics, or overly casual attire.
- ✅ **Engage actively** – Listen, respect different views, and avoid talking over others.

## After The Meeting

- **Action items assigned & tracked in MOM** – Who's doing what, by when; ensure tasks are visible and integrated into workflows.
- **Follow-up shared** – Notes & tasks sent within 24 hours (Slack works).
- **Track progress in MOM** – Ensure follow-ups actually happen.

## If You Can't Make It

- **Let the organiser know ASAP** – Slack, WhatsApp, or a quick call.
- **Suggest an alternative** – Reschedule or send a delegate if needed.

## Keep Improving

Meetings will be reviewed biannually—give feedback anytime to help make them better. We'll do a meeting reset to reassess frequency, format, and necessity, ensuring our time is well spent.
