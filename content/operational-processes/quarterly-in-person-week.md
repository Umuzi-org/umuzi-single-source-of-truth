# Quarterly In-Person Week

This event is an essential part of our company culture, providing time for team building, strategy sharing, and strengthening our connections.

## Who Needs to Be There?

### Gauteng-Based Team Members

If you're living in Gauteng, it's a must to attend the in-person days. We want everyone to be part of it!

### Flying In?

If you're based outside of Gauteng and your participation is needed for a workshop or event, travel will be arranged subject to Exco approval. We'll give you the details well in advance if you're selected.

### Leave During In-Person Week

Managers won't approve leave during this week unless there's a really good reason. If something urgent pops up, chat with your manager and we'll handle it case by case.

### Plan Ahead

These in-person weeks are already scheduled on the **Umuzi Annual Calendar**, so be sure to plan around them.

## Workshops & Events

### Be Proactive

While there are planned events, teams are encouraged to take the initiative to organise their own workshops or planning sessions. This is your time to connect and work on what matters most to your team!

### Be Involved

There will also be some key workshops and events organised. If you're involved, you'll be notified in advance.

## Questions?

Got any questions or not sure what's expected? Feel free to reach out to your manager or **Chief of Staff**!

Looking forward to seeing everyone in person—it's always great when we can connect face-to-face! 🤝
