# Prioritising Thoughtful and Constructive Feedback in 2025

This year, we are placing a major focus on taking the time to give thoughtful, constructive feedback. Managers play a vital role in creating an environment where feedback is not only routine but meaningful, actionable, and impactful. Below, we've outlined the reasons behind this focus, the value it adds, and clear expectations for integrating feedback into your team management practices.

## Why Feedback Matters

Thoughtful feedback is a cornerstone of growth and alignment. By making it a priority, we aim to:

- **Empower Development:** Well-delivered feedback helps employees recognise their strengths, address areas for improvement, and unlock their potential.
- **Strengthen Relationships:** Constructive conversations foster trust, deepen connections, and show employees they are valued.
- **Drive Excellence:** Feedback ensures alignment with Umuzi values, culture, and goals, helping us perform at our best.

When feedback is intentional and constructive, it becomes a powerful tool for both individual and team success.

## Our 2025 Feedback Expectations

To ensure consistency and impact, here are the key practices we expect managers to follow:

### 1. 360 Feedback on SageHR

- Encourage full participation during the 360-feedback process.
- Provide thoughtful, balanced, and specific feedback for each team member.
- Use the feedback to identify alignment with Umuzi values and opportunities for growth.

### 2. Regular Feedback Sessions

- Schedule one-on-one feedback sessions regularly with team members.
- Move beyond performance metrics; focus on personal growth, achievements, and actionable areas for development.
- Create a safe space for open dialogue and collaborative goal setting.

### 3. Counselling Sessions

- Leverage counselling sessions for deeper, more personal conversations about challenges, development, and well-being.
- Use these sessions to build trust, offer support, and provide guidance.

### 4. Timely and Balanced Feedback

- Deliver feedback as close to the event or activity as possible to ensure it's relevant and actionable.
- Balance constructive feedback with recognition of accomplishments and progress.
- Be specific and provide examples to make your feedback actionable and clear.

## The Value of Thoughtful Feedback

When feedback becomes an integral part of how we lead, we create a culture of accountability, trust, and growth. Here's what thoughtful feedback achieves:

- **Stronger, More Aligned Teams:** Open and constructive conversations create shared purpose and collaboration.
- **Culture of Accountability and Growth:** Employees understand expectations and feel motivated to improve.
- **Increased Trust and Engagement:** Honest feedback shows employees that their contributions and development matter.

2. **Commit to Feedback Sessions:** Build feedback into your regular management practice—schedule it, plan it, and make it meaningful.
3. **Model Feedback Culture:** Share your own experiences with feedback during team discussions and lead by example.
